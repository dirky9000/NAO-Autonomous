# NAO Autonomous Vehicle

The goal of this senior project is to design and build an autonomous vehicle that can be steered by an NAO robot through the use of four buttons for steering. The vehicle should be able to drive forward and backward and left and right with the buttons. Sensors will be placed in the front and back of the vehicle for object detection. A microcontroller will be placed on the base plate and operate as the brain for decision-making. It will take in the readings from the sensors, interpret them, make a decision, and send the necessary action needed to the NAO robot to carry out.

The end goal is to have the autonomous vehicle, steered by the NAO, navigate one of the hallways of TCNJ. The smooth communication between sensors, microcontroller, NAO, and the vehicle will allow it to turn down hallways and detect and avoid any obstacles in its way.
